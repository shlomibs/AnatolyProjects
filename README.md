Hi Guys,
Welcome to your GitHub repository !

Few rules:
- Each student will have a separate branch. 
  MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR BRANCH ONLY !

- Students may fork to new branches, only from their own branch.

- Non-indicative commit messages are a big-no-no !

- Each projet will have the following directory structure:
	- <Project name>
		- README.md 	- Will contain the project description
		- src 		- A root directory for the project sources
		- docs		- A root directory for the project docs

- Feel free to discuss about any considerations regarding the directory structure.
